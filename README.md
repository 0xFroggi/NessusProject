# Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Project
### Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Implementation using Virtual Machines

**Project Overview:**

This project involved deploying a vulnerability scanner to learn how to identify and address security flaws, enhancing my expertise in securing systems.

**Project Details:**

I set up:

- **Windows 10 Virtual Machine**: Made intentionally vulnerable by stopping automatic updates, turning off the firewall, and installing outdated, insecure software.
- **Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine**: Installed and configured with Nessus Vulnerability Scanner software to scan and detect security issues on the Windows machine.
