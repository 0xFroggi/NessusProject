# Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Project
### Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Implementation using Virtual Machines

**Project Overview:**

This project involved deploying a vulnerability scanner to learn how to identify and address security flaws, enhancing my expertise in securing systems.

**Project Details:**

I set up:

- **Windows 10 Virtual Machine**: Made intentionally vulnerable by stopping automatic updates, turning off the firewall, and installing outdated, insecure software.
- **Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine**: Installed and configured with Nessus Vulnerability Scanner software to scan and detect security issues on the Windows machine.

1. Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Dashboard
- The Nessus dashboard is designed to provide an intuitive interface for security professionals to manage vulnerability scans effectively.
- Users can select from various predefined scan templates tailored to different types of vulnerabilities and scenarios, making it easier to identify and mitigate security risks in their networks.
- The sidebar offers easy access to scan policies, plugin configurations, and additional tools for comprehensive security management.
